# Predictive Maintenance

Our project focuses on the development of an application that utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict machine failures in advance. By harnessing the insights derived from a synthetic dataset comprising 10,000 data points and 14 features, our application offers a sophisticated approach to predictive maintenance.


At the heart of our application lies a Random Forest Classifier, a robust ensemble learning method capable of handling both numerical and categorical features. Trained on the synthetic dataset, this model discerns patterns and relationships within the data to accurately predict whether a machine is likely to experience failure.

Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. It belongs to the family of decision tree-based algorithms and is known for its robustness, flexibility, and high predictive accuracy. Here's an overview of the Random Forest model:
